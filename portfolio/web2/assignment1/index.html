			  In the article “Stop Talking to Each Other and Start Buying Things: Three Decades of Survival in the Desert of Social Media”, Catheryne M. Valente expresses deep anger and frustration about the state of social media, particularly Twitter, tracing the issues back to the early days of the internet. Valente recounts the positive experiences on platforms like Prodigy and Livejournal, where users posted content freely and uncontrolled, unadvertised, emphasizing the importance of community and connection. Valente highlights the repeated cycle of social media platforms being created, flourishing, and then succumbing to corporate interests and harmful practices, ultimately leading to their demise. Valente condemns the actions of individuals like Elon Musk, expressing concern about the impact on independent artists and the loss of spaces for genuine human connection. Despite the frustration, she encourages readers to keep talking to each other, to cherish the connections made online, and to create new spaces for genuine interaction and community. Overall this is a very passionate article. Valente discusses the fragility of societal progress and warns against complacency, noting that even seemingly resolved issues can resurface if not actively addressed. She questions the concentration of power in the hands of a few individuals and the potential negative impact said power can have on collectively created entities, such as Twitter. When Valente typed, "One unimaginably rich man should not be able to destroy something the world created together, for good or ill." She was referring to how Elon Musk took Twitter, a community platform that “is and was nothing. Humanity made that place.” She continues to justify how impactful the platform is when she says, “Twitter is and was the home to so many small artists who clawed their way to an audience.” Valente feels heartbroken that many small artists and poets were ripped apart from their readers and general audience when Musk inherited the platform. Many users deleted the app or migrated to other apps, leaving creators having to fend for themselves and get on the grind once again. Valente feels very passionately that in order to avoid a situation like this again where authors need to rebuild their platform, they should avoid social media altogether. At the end of the article Valente urges her readers to, "Stop buying things and start talking to each other. They’ve always known that was how they lose." because she believes that true power lies in communication and connection, not in mindless consumption. This is also a very important piece of information because Valente mentions that most content created on all platforms in the first place is not only fandom based but community based. She mentions, “Geeks, though. Us weird geeks making communities in the ether? We love. We love so stupidly hard.” Valente continues her stream of consciousness by communicating to her audience that those in charge of making decisions and those who have the loudest voices on social media platforms are full of hate, despair, and demise. She acknowledges the passion and love within online communities, especially those formed by enthusiasts or "weird geeks." On the contrary, people who are in charge of managing these online communities don't follow this format, for example she talks about how “Sometimes I don’t even think they love themselves. Sometimes I’m pretty sure of it. They certainly never seem happy, even when they win. Musk doesn’t seem happy at all.” Valente talks to her audience about how the people who use platforms like twitter will be screaming into the air to try and make their voices heard to a god in the heavens, but there's no way to get past all this air. Valente continues, “The energy we make in these spaces, the energy we make when we support and uplift and encourage and excite each other is something people like Musk can never understand or experience.” Which is why we must reframe our own platforms full of the “little things” such as “Love things and love each other. We’re good at that, too. Protect the vulnerable. Make little things. Wear electric blue eyeshadow. Take a picture of your breakfast. Overthink Twin Peaks. Get angry. Do revolutions. Find out what Buffy character you are. Don’t get cynical. Don’t lose joy. Be us. Because us is what keeps the light on when the night comes closing in. Us doesn’t have a web address. We are wherever we gather.” because content on platforms is just content from our souls and our minds and it is us as the human that brings people together and not the big giant evil overlord guarding our thoughts and feelings.
