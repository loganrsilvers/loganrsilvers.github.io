  		Mimi is 77 years old</p>
  		<p>Her first positive about having babies was that “babies are cute.” and what's more is that they rely on you full time to do everything for them. “It depends on your personality but I like it when the baby needs me.” </p>
  		<p> Mimi said that the baby years were some of the best years of her life because she liked to buy the baby cute little outfits and toys and it gave her an experience to pamper a tiny human. </p>
  		<br>
			<p>
  		Want to know more? Check out the opinion of this 47 year old named Suzy. </p>
  		<p>Suzy stated that her number one benefit having a baby was for connection: Being able to bond with her partner and her family. </p>
  		<p>Suzy’s second pro is that having a baby provides the opportunity to raise someone who can do good in the world, and add on to the positive impact you can leave for society.

  <div id="container3" class="right2">

  		<p>She also liked the fact that the babies copy you, and that they can mimic your behaviors and like the same things that you like, they can copy your faces and laugh when you laugh and sing when you sing. </p>
  		<p>Mimi likes celebrating the holidays, it makes her feel closer and connected to her mom when she shows the baby her interests. One of the pros she wanted to highlight was that “the baby eats all the time, and they are growing and sooner or later they cook themselves the food I made for them when they were younger!”
  	</p>
  
  	<br>
  	<p>Suzy also stated babies brings joy and happiness into her life. She continues with shared love by stating that there is an immediate impact on someone's life, a happy impact, that you are making and you can instantly see it in the baby.</p>
  	<p>Her third pro was that babies provide a shared love. She talked about this instant feedback loop (ex: i made baby happy, I love baby, baby loves me) that never ends when you have a baby.   </p>
