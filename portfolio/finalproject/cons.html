  	<p>
  		The first person I interviewed for this project is a 7 year old named Lyra.  </p>
  		<p>When I first originally asked her about if she was going to have any babies when she grew up she put down a very heavy “NO!” She continued on with the fact that babies are often very messy - as in they often throw food on the ground during their toddler years and they also can knock down towers and stomp on things.</p>
  		<p>The primary reason - other than the fact that “babies are GROSS! And they poop in your face!” - that Lyra did not want to have any babies when she grew up, and even if she did want to be around children because she enjoys the experience, she would like to confine it to a controlled environment that is strictly within her desired 9-5. 
  	</p>
<br>
  	<p>
  		Secondly for this project I interviewed 47 year old named Suzy. </p>
  		<p>Her number one con for having a baby was expense, everyday expenses triple or sometimes quadruple for her in ways you would not normally expect. This includes money expenses such as more food ion the house, more gas in the car, more time off work, you need vaccines after the baby is born, insurance, and car seats, etc.  </p> 
  		<p>Secondly, Suzy said the second con about having a baby was time management. For example, everything you are doing you have to do with the baby, you cook with the baby, drive with the baby, go to the store with the baby, the baby goes everywhere. You don't have any alone time with the baby until they are able to spend time on their own.

  	<p>
  	The third interview that I conducted with Mimi, a 77 year old </p>
  	<p>Her first con of her three big cons were that </p>
  		<ul><li><p>They cry all the time. She continued that she often could not figure out what was wrong with the baby or why it was crying and by the end of the day Mimi was exhausted because she would always have to go to work the next day without much sleep. </p></li>
  			<li><p>Her second con is when babies grow up, they leave you. She knows it is a part of life, but it was still a little heartbreaking when her babies grew up and left her to start their own lives without her. </p></li>
  			<li><p>Mimi is an educator, and she said that sometimes you would think the babies are ready for certain activities and they were not, and it was really heartbreaking to see when the baby is not prepared for things.</p></li>
  		</ul>
