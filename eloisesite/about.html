                Hello! I am a Chicago native and an Environmental and Sustainability studies and illustration double major at Columbia College Chicago. I've been immersed in the Chicago art scene from a young age and thus very tied with my community. I am fascinated by the natural world and adopt much of its aesthetics into my artwork. Currently, I am practicing and studying to become a scientific illustrator one day. I aim to blend the worlds of art and science through my artwork as a means of making education accessible. I strongly believe that education through art will lead us to a more sustainable future. Feel free to say hi! I love meeting new people and hearing about their passions.
