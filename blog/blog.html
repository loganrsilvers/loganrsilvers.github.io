        <h1>Hello,</h1>

        <p>My name is Logan and I am currently a 20 year old living in chicago who is interested in different yarn brands and yarn textures - I like to crochet. I also enjoy a lot of websites on neocities and thus - sparked my love of coding.</p>

            <p>in my second class of the day, i am in game development or Intro to Game Development and someone cool came to talk to our class</p>
            
            <p><b>Bill Guschwan</b> is a professor at columbia and he sounds like he does a lot of cool things, I came into columbia to do art with code and they cut out the physical computing class, after bill came to talk to the game class about his life story he was talking about how he built playstations and worked on a bunch of game systems</p>
            <p>with this information i decided to prompt him a quesiton about what happened to the physical computing class, because they made a fashion and gaming minor, but it is only virtual.</p>
            <p>bill pulled me and my friend <b>Alice Loveland</b> (very awesome person, very pink) aside to give me his email and tell me i can reach out to him for different opprotunities to learn physical computing outside of class, or independent study options, captsone options, etc. My hope is for him to email me the secret canvas curriculum for physical computing, i can work through it on my own, and i can get college credit for it.</p>
            <p>I am hoping for the best, but i am also concerned... <u>about me.</u></p>
            <p>the problem is that I am really into website development right now, I am a little tight on money and I already deleted tiktok, so I am having some gaps in my free time i am slowly relearning to fill. Over the last four weeks it has really just been me and my computer (and my bf shamus ofc... but mostly me and my computer) and I have grown my love for web development and coding websites - which is why you can read this site right now.</p>
            <p>time is a valuable commodity. which is why i am so efficient mwaha >:)</p>
            <p>over the weekend I assembled my evil team of evil web development eboard members for our <a href="https://webdevclub.github.io/webdevclub.io/">web dev club</a> which may also be known as my cleverly secured the title, "websites websites websites".</p>
            <p>anyway the point being - I already chose my new hobby! and it's websites! I already chose you!</p>
            <p>...</p>
            <p>I can always un-choose you</p>
            <p>right?</p>
            <p>can I trust in myself to pursue this new hobby of physical computing? maybe the only reason i thought it was fun before was my awesome classmates of awesomeness and i had an environment where i felt like , accepted and i belonged and i was quirky and super spunky and everyone loved every one of my ideas, i felt like a leader, i cried when the class ended and we said goodbye, i - yknow - it was my class. am i just chasing the feeling i had in high school? what if i take this physcial computing class (whatever it means) and i end up folling out of love with <i>both</i> web development <i>and</i> physical computing? I dont want to make a choice to give one of them up and loose interest in both aaannnnddd I cont want to not choose physical computing and missed out on something that <i>could</i> have been awesome.</p>
            <p>what do you think i should do reader?</p>
            <p>what would you choose?</p>

            <h2>2025-02-19-1</h2>
            <p>today I am in my baby class - it is technically called Human Development EDUC 115 but its literally a class that teaches you about how babies grow and learn and the different things babies need to support themselves</p>
        
            <p><b>Today's class notes:</b> today we are mostly talking about the <i>Erickson chart</i> which is a stages of development index that basically is made up of multiple stages. Infancy, early childhood, preschool, school age, adolescence, young adulthood, middle adulthood, and maturity</p>
            <p>for babies in infancy, you have trust and mistrust.</p>
            <p>okay pause nvm , at this moment we are wathcing a documentary about babies </p>
