            My goal for this semester is to add at least two highly creative, thoughtful, and strong projects to my portfolio surrounding web development. Last semester I was able to fully sculpt a professional level portfolio for my Illustration friend Eloise. This taught me a lot about the industry standard for web development regarding graphic design, and that many companies are still primarily using Wordpress with WooCommerce or Shopify. I also took away that I need to work on being faster with deliverables and to practice more strenuous technical skills.
