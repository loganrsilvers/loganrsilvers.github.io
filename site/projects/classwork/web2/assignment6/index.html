  	<div id="text">Fish Communicate with Sound: While often overlooked, many fish species communicate using sound. They produce a variety of sounds for different purposes, such as mating, defending territory, or warning others of danger. Some species, like the codfish, produce sounds by vibrating their swim bladders, while others, like the grunts and croakers, use muscles associated with their swim bladders to make sounds. Some Fish Can Walk: Yes, you read that right! There are several species of fish that are capable of walking on land for short distances. One remarkable example is the mudskipper, found in tropical coastal regions. These fish have adapted pectoral fins that function like legs, allowing them to move across mudflats and even climb trees. Walking fish have evolved this ability to explore different habitats and find food.Fish Have an Incredible Variety of Eyes: Fish eyes come in an astonishing array of shapes, sizes, and configurations, each suited to the specific needs of the species. For instance, some deep-sea fish have enormous eyes to capture as much light as possible in the dark depths, while others, like flounders, have both eyes on one side of their head, allowing them to lie flat on the ocean floor and ambush prey. Additionally, some fish, such as the four-eyed fish, have eyes that are divided into two parts, allowing them to see both above and below the water simultaneously.</div>
  	<div id="fish2"></div>
	<!-- I changed the id below to "text2" -->
  	<div id="text2">Fish Can Have Long-Term Memories: Contrary to the common belief that fish have short attention spans, studies have shown that many fish species have impressive long-term memories. For example, some species of fish can remember complex spatial maps of their surroundings, recall feeding locations, and even recognize individual members of their social groups. This cognitive ability helps them navigate their environments, find food, and avoid predators. Fish Are Masters of Camouflage: Many fish have evolved remarkable camouflage abilities to blend in with their surroundings and avoid predators or ambush prey. For instance, the leafy sea dragon closely resembles floating seaweed, while the stonefish resembles a rock on the ocean floor. Additionally, some fish can change their coloration and patterns rapidly to match their environment, providing them with excellent camouflage against various backgrounds. Fish Have a Remarkable Sense of Taste: Fish have taste buds not only in their mouths but also all over their bodies, including their fins and even their lips. This extensive distribution of taste buds helps fish detect and distinguish between different chemical cues in the water, including those indicating the presence of food, potential mates, or predators. Some species of fish, like catfish, even have specialized taste buds called barbels that help them locate food in murky waters or dark environments.</div>
  	<div id="fish3"></div>
  	<div id="text3">Some Fish Build Intricate Nests: Just like birds construct nests for their eggs, some species of fish build intricate nests to protect their eggs and offspring. For example, the male stickleback fish constructs a nest out of vegetation and other materials, carefully arranging them to create a safe environment for the eggs. Male seahorses have specialized pouches where they carry and protect developing embryos until they are ready to hatch. These nesting behaviors showcase the diversity of parental care strategies among fish species.Fish Can Use Tools: While it's commonly associated with primates and birds, tool use has also been observed in certain species of fish. For instance, the orange-dotted tuskfish in the Great Barrier Reef has been observed using rocks to crack open shellfish for food. Similarly, the archerfish can shoot jets of water at insects above the water's surface, knocking them into the water where they can be easily consumed. These examples demonstrate the remarkable problem-solving abilities and adaptability of fish. Fish Have Been Sent Into Space: In various scientific experiments, fish have been sent into space to study the effects of microgravity on their physiology and behavior. For example, in 1973, NASA launched the Skylab 3 mission, which included an aquarium containing fish. Observing fish in space helps researchers understand how gravity influences fundamental biological processes such as bone density, muscle development, and orientation behavior. These experiments contribute to our knowledge of how living organisms adapt to space environments.</div>
