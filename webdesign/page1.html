		<h2>fun facts about BUGS!!</h2>
		<div style="text-align: left;">
		<p>Houseflies find sugar with their feet, which are 10 million times more sensitive than human tongues.</p>
<p>Ticks can grow from the size of a grain of rice to the size of a marble.</p>
<p>Approximately 2,000 silkworm cocoons are needed to produce one pound of silk.</p>
<p>While gathering food, a bee may fly up to 60 miles in one day.</p>
<p>Ants can lift and carry more than fifty times their own weight.</p>
<p>Mexican Jumping Beans, sometimes sold commercially, actually have a caterpillar of a bean moth inside.</p>
<p>The male silk moth is estimated to "smell" chemicals of female silk moths in the air at the ratio of a few hundred molecules among 25 quintillion (25,000,000,000,000,000,000) molecules in a cubic centimeter of air.</p>
<p>True flies have only one pair of wings, and sometimes, none at all. A hind pair of "wings" is reduced to balancing organs called halteres.</p>
<p>There are about 91,000 different kinds (species) of insects in the United States. In the world, some 1.5 million different kinds (species) have been named.</p>
<p>A particular Hawk Moth caterpillar from Brazil, when alarmed, raises its head and inflates its thorax, causing it to look like the head of a snake.</p>
<p>About one-third of all insect species are carnivorous, and most hunt for their food rather than eating decaying meat or dung.</p>
