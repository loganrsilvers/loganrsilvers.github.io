                    <p>this was a wild, wild ride, of many errors and trials and errors to get this thing to work - hence my frustrated face at the end. lemme walk you through it. </p>

                    <h2><strong>The beginning - which is actually like the monday before this</strong></h2>

                    <p>so i had already told shamus what my idea was and asked him to reserve it, so he put down the $80 deposit (or whatever it was) for like 1/1:30pmish on the friday feb 14th. I had reserved the day off work at my tutoring job, and he was clear, and i told him to confirm with his parents like one million times and he was like yeah i got it i got it and so its done. </p>
                    <p>so we're there - right - no wait no were not - so like two days before this is set to happen i am not sure how i find out exactly but essentially shamus comes to me and hes like "yeah so my dad is going to work that day so i have to stay home to pick up lyra so we might have to leave the escape room early to pick her up so we can still go" [bc we have to be home - or at his home i mean - around 2:30/2:45 at the latest] </p>
                    <p>so obviously im peeved / but also then shamus didnt make the reservation for the escape room actually - so its not that big of a deal - so im like yay you didnt make the reservation! we can come up with something different so we can still have a cool day without blowing a lot of money, and we can go pick up lyra. </p>
                    <p>he informs me that as we are speaking he made th eescape room reservation for 2pm.... and he already paid the deposit</p>

                    <h2><strong>the middle, which is valentines DAY. </strong></h2>
                    <div style="border-bottom: 8px solid #6ccff6ff;"></div>

                    <p>so shamus comes over some time in the morning. he brings me these flowers: </p>
                    <figure class="box2">
                        <img src="css/img/vdayflowers.jpg"style="width: 100%;"alt="escape room img">
                    </figure>
                    <p>which are (i believe) a combination of blue hydrangeas (akin to the flowers he got me for last year's valentines day) purple flowers similar to purple caspia idk what he picked, and roses that are more specifically called idk like a rio samba rose or whatever they are fire roses thing, theres some babys breath in there too but not much</p>
                    <p>every valentines (so far - cause we have only had two of them) shamus wakes up early in the morning to go to marianos and he is able to customize the buquet and pick our whatever flowers he wants,, i think its really cute because i like how personalized they are and i can look at how is brain is working on that day.</p>
                    <p>that wasn't the only gift though, shamus also brought me a new set of rings!!!!!!</p>
                    <figure class="box2">
                        <img src="css/img/vdayrings.jpg"style="width: 100%;"alt="escape room img">
                    </figure>
                    <p>this was a huge suprise to me! our last rings were a gift that he brought me for our one-year last july - and they were adventuring smth smth - the last ones were getting a little old cause idk how to polish them but i thought they were alright. anyways these ones are blue sandstone - they look black to me - and blue sandstone is supposed to symbol "power, attertiveness, ambition, blah" idk lemme clip a picture.</p>
                    <p>okay all the pictures r trash - it is pretty and definetly an upgrade from the last one - i like it very much - also his looks much better w/ the silver stuff in there - his last one was purple.</p>
