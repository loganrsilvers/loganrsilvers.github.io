                    <p><strong>here are our faces that we painted and our jouneyyss</strong></p>
                    
                    <figure>
                        <img src="css/img/squidface.jpg" alt="logan and shamus under the sea face paint" style="width:100%">
                        <figcaption>Logan and Shamus at the Hot Dog Festival (in Chicago)</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p><strong>Logan has an octopus and Shamus has a matching Squid</strong></p>
                    <p>This is when we were hanging out w/ shamus's friends : glen and santi</p>

                    <p>This was the chicago hot dog festival or wherever it was - it was next to shamus's jimmy johns job where he delivery drives the worlds most famous jimmy johns picklewiches to everyone in the neighborhood. Hes a neighborhood hero he is.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p><strong>Logan has a glitter butterfly and Shamus has a glitter green spider</strong></p>
                    <p>(not pictured is logan is matching with shamus's sister Lyra's butterfly)</p>

                    <p>Logan enjoyed the dark mode kind of things for the sparkles, but she typically goes for a more under the sea theme. The sparkels got into our eyes later - not fun. Also other than the face painting the fesivals usually tend to be a very expensive flop.</p>

                        <figcaption>skeleton face at the six flags (shamus didnt get one bc we didnt like this face paint)</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p><strong>this is one of my least favorite face painting things</strong></p>
                    <p>i did not enjoy this skull that i paid an overpriced $45 for, i thought it was a total flop</p>
                    <p>i went to noctruna after this with my friends eloise and anabelle for halloween themed nocturna night thing, i thought it was a fun outing and we took this absolutely bonk uber who had party light like cray, but it was chill otherwise than the face paint - cause this face paint was ASS</p>
