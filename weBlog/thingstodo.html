                    <p>A jungle food challenge could sound incomprehensible by it's name if you don't know what I am talking about. </p>
                    <p>A jungle food challenge is a challenge that involves <strong>attempting to create the most god awful abomination of what could be an edible item.</strong> </p>
                    <p>For each player or duo they must have their own meal type: Such as breakfast, lunch, dinner, or dessert. You can make any meal you desire that is in the scope of the meal theme, and your aim is to make it smell, feel, and taste as disgusting as possible. </p>
                    <p>The other players will taste and give you a rating out of 10 for how horrible your food is and the person with the highest score wins. The most IMPORTANT rule which is the heart of the whole game is that you can only make the food as disgusting as YOU can handle. If you're unable to taste your own food, then you're not allowed to make other players taste your food.</p>

                    <p>A sleep function is commonly confused with a sleep OVER function. The main difference is a sleep function has the express purpose of sleeping during the middle of the day as the main activity during the hangout, so typically you bring more supplies to enhance the sleeping experience and often there is a spotify playlist playing music from everyone involved in the sleep function while everyone sleeps. </p>
                    <p>I'd say that this is a good idea if everyone involved is non-verbal for various reasons such as greening out or sleep deprivation. I have found that I had a very spiritual experience after a sleep function.</p>
                
                    <h2><strong>A classic hang out idea that I have never regretted is hosting a movie at your house </strong></h2>
                    <p>(usually one agreed upon by the group beforehand). One of my favorite examples was when I hosted around 15 people in my home theater setup (cause im rich) and everyone was crowded around and yes it was quite warm in said room and a little stinky, but having so many people created what felt like a cohesive audience to fully enjoy and absorb and consume media. I felt like a collective hive mind as everyone was reacting the exact same way at every scene. Food is also great and should always be a factor during a movie night. My favorite movie that I have watched in this regard was Nobody with the glorious Bob Odenkirk (literally me).</p>

                    <p>A cruel and unusual function idea which might be blacklisted is a squid game function. </p>
                    <p>I was inspired by the games in the show that I thought, y'know I could do a smaller scale version of this with American games instead! One game I had in mind was Twister but some of the spots have mouse traps or other traps and contestants who land on them are “eliminated”. </p>
                    <p>I currently have three elimination ideas: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>getting paintballed by all alive contestants,</li>
                        <li>getting electrocuted via a collar,</li>
                        <li>or just waterboarded.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I will have to test these ideas. </p>
                    <div style="border-bottom: 8px solid #6ccff6ff;"></div>

                    <p>The second game that could be involved in the OWOgang Summer Squid Games that I came up with is piss roulette where there's a hundred or so cups and five or ten of them are apple juice and the other half is coyote urine. I am excited to update you guys with more squid game variants I will come up with in the future.</p>

                    <p>	Overall, I'd say that hang outs are an art and one that is enjoyed by all whether it be spontaneous or planned. Whether it's as a group or between hosts and guests. </p>
                    <p>In a time where we are spending less time in person and more time online, I'd like to provide you with ways that might make said time in person more fun potentially and help you become better friends with those you know as I have with.</p>
