                    <h1>Blood ball</h1>
                    <p>shamus took me out to columbia chicago's blood ball - he bought a suit with his mom at nordstroms the night before - and i got to pick out the tie colors with him while he was in the store - and he sent me one million pictures</p>
                    <p>blood ball was super cute and nice, and i remember the theme being enchanted garden - which reminded me of the homecoming i went to senior year in my high school - except for the homecoming i went by myself and i just took pictures with all my friends, because i didnt have a boyfriend i could take with me.</p>
                    <p>this dance was very fancy, because it was the first one where i got to take a boyfriend with me, and it felt really cute and special because shamus kept me in the loop of everything he was doing t get ready every step of the way. it is one of my most favorite dates of ours.</p>
                    <p>i also tried a new drink that night called <strong>yerba mate</strong>. i didnt like it.</p>
                    <p>shamus is my favorite boyfriend in the whole planet, which is why we are surrounded by space and sparkle to match how wonderful my shamus is</p>
                    <p>i hope to have one million more days with shamus that are just as magical and special and i already have. I also hope to take one million more photos for my new blog that i am making with shamus. i like websites.</p>
